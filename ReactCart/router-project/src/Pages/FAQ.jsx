            <div className="Questions"> 
                <p className="PHeading">How do you ensure the safety of parcels when it is in transit?</p>
                <p  className="PContent">The safety of parcels in every stage has been ensured. At every hub, thermal scanners have been installed. Our delivery partners take adequate safety measures such as disinfecting surroundings, maintaining a safe distance, use of masks, gloves etc. However, it is always recommended to wash hands with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean your hands after receiving any parcel.</p>

                <p  className="PHeading">At the time of delivery, can we use a card on delivery or UPI payment option for COD orders?</p>
                <p  className="PContent"> As of now, we accept UPIs on delivery only for the orders from 'Daily Essentials' category. However, we are working on setting up the process to accept both cards or UPI at the delivery for our entire orders. The process is still in progress and we are hopeful that soon we will be able to avoid cash on all COD orders. Till then we request you to place pre-paid orders for non-essentials so that we can avoid cash transactions. </p>

                <p  className="PHeading">What about quality of products?</p>
                <p className="PContent">At Meesho, we have stringent quality checks and ensure that we onboard only high-quality suppliers. In case the product quality is not up to the mark, we provide easy return and exchange policy.   Further, we actively take user feedback on product quality, post delivery. You can also see this feedback in form of Ratings & Reviews on Product Details page.   This feedback improves our quality check process and removes poor quality suppliers.</p>
