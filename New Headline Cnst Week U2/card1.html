                  <p> <b>1889</b>  <br>
                    Birth of <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">Herbie Taylo</b> , South Africa's first world-class batter and an absolute master on matting pitches. 
                    Taylor's finest innings was a brilliant 176 against England in <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">Johannesburg in 1922-23</b> , a match in which the next-highest 
                    score was 50, and one of only four occasions Taylor was on the winning side in his 42 Tests. In all, he made three centuries and a
                     91 in that series; all of his seven Test hundreds came against England. He was captain for 18 Tests either side of the First World War, in 
                     which he served in the Royal Field Artillery. Taylor took up coaching schoolboys upon retirement, and died in Cape Town in 1973.</p>

               <b>1933</b>  <br>
                One of Jamaica's favourite sons is born. <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">Collie Smith</b> was an attacking batter, an outstanding fielder and a useful offspinner, 
                who gave up fast bowling as a young man in a bid to emulate his hero Jim Laker. In 1954-55, in only his third first-class match, he cracked 
                169 against the touring Australians, and was given a <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">Test debut</b> on his home ground as a result. He flashed a superb 104 in the second innings, 
                although it wasn't enough to save West Indies from defeat. Smith's last Test hundred came in Delhi in 1958-59, when he also took his only five-for. 
                He was only 26 when he was killed in a car crash in Stoke-on-Trent in 1959, in which Garry Sobers was also involved. When Smith's body was returned to J
                amaica, over 60,000 people attended his funeral.</p>

          <div class="content2">
              <p> <b>2010</b>
                A historic day for women's cricket. West Indies' <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">Deandra Dottin</b> smashed the first T20I hundred, off just 38 balls, 
                en route to a 45-ball 112 against South Africa's women in the World T20 <b style="color: #2cb9ff;"> in St Kitts</b>. The second fifty of the whirlwind innings came up in 13 balls as West I
                ndies raced to their first win of the tournament, one where they would eventually lose to New Zealand in the semi-final.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content2">
            <p> <b>2019</b> <br>
                The <b style="color: #2cb9ff;"> biggest opening partnership in ODI history</b>. Against Ireland in Dublin, Shai Hope and John Campbell made personal bests
                 of 170 and 179 in a stand of 365, which took West Indies to  <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">their second-highest ODI total - 381</b>. The mammoth chase proved too difficult for Ireland, 
                 who only two months before had been fighting West Indies for a place in the World Cup. They folded for 185 in 35 overs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content2">
            <p> <b>1911</b> <br>
                A distinctly unlucky one-cap wonder is born. Lancashire's <b style="color: #2cb9ff;"> Norman Oldfield</b> did not do a lot wrong when he made 
                a stylish 80 and 19 in his England debut, against West Indies at <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">The Oval in 1939</b>. But that was the last Test before the Second World War, and when Test cricket
                 returned, Oldfield was well into his thirties, and past his prime. He later became an umpire and officiated in two Tests. He died in Blackpool in 1996.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content2">
            <p> <b>1962</b> <br>
                Another one-cap wonder is born. <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">James Whitaker</b> was a member of England's Ashes-winning side in 1986-87. He made his one appearance <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">in Adelaide</b>, when Ian
                Botham was injured, and managed 11 before falling to Bruce Reid. With David Gower and Phil DeFreitas also playing, England included three Leicestershire players
                for the first time. Whitaker remained a one-club man, and led Leicester to the County Championship in 1996 and 1998. After being forced to retire with a leg injury 
                he had a spell as general manager at Grace Road.  </p>

            <p> <b>2003</b> <br>
                The day <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">Jermaine Lawson</b> completed a hat-trick in the third Test against <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">Australia in Barbados</b>. After picking up the wickets of Brett Lee and Stuart MacGill in
                 the first innings, Lawson struck with his very first ball of the second innings when he trapped Justin Langer lbw. That, though, had absolutely no bearing on 
                 the result of the Test as Australia knocked off a meagre eight required for victory and took an imposing 3-0 lead in the series. After the next match of the 
                 series that contained the historic 418-run chase, Lawson's action came under scrutiny by the ICC.</p>

        <div class="content2">
            <p> <b>1968</b> <br>
                An Australian coach is born. Talented wicketkeeper-batter <b style="color: #2cb9ff;">Tim Nielsen</b>, who made 316 first-class dismissals for South Australia, went on to assist John Buchanan in 
                coaching the Redbacks and then the Australian team. In 2007 he took over the national role from Buchanan, but it was a period of transition for the team and 
                Nielsen's reign saw them lose two successive Ashes series and the World Cup title, which they had held since 1999. He stepped down in 2011 and took on a 
                youth-development role for South Australia.</p>
