                             But especially in T20Is, this is a largely inexperienced side that will need a captain who can continue to provide vision and clarity. Pooran excelled with the bat in his last international assignment, 
                             in India earlier this year, averaging 61.33 with a strike rate of 140.45 across three T20Is. He will hold the team to the same high standards Pollard did.</p>

                        <p>As well as captaining and leading the middle order through these games, Pooran will also be keeping wicket in T20Is, a fair responsibility. 
                            All signs so far suggest he excels under such responsibility - both his average and strike rate are significantly higher in the T20Is he's captained in - though he may well relinquish 
                            the gloves for some matches in order to balance that workload.</p>

                        <p> <b> West Indies' bowling woes </b> <br>
                            A clear problem with the side in both white-ball formats is the inability to take wickets. The struggles have seen veteran bowlers such as Fidel Edwards, 
                            Kemar Roach and Ravi Rampaul recalled to white-ball cricket since the turn of 2021. One advantage that Pooran has is that <b style="color: #03A9Fa;">  Obed McCoy </b> 
                            is now fit and available to play for the first time since last year's T20 World Cup. As a strike bowler who is effective in the Powerplay, he will be a massive asset.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p><b style="color: #03A9Fa;"> Alzarri Joseph </b> has built a reputation for big-name wickets in ODI cricket, but he has lacked consistency in the format. 
                            It will be up to Pooran to try and get the best out of him. Some good performances for the Gujarat Titans in this season's IPL indicate that Joseph could also be handed a T20I debut in the coming months.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Also intriguing will be whether Pooran has any influence in handing the talented <b style="color: #03A9Fa;">Jayden Seales </b> a white-ball debut to partner McCoy. 
                            Seales was included in white-ball squads earlier this year but not chosen for the starting XI. With squads set to be rotated in order to manage the schedule, 
                            it would be surprising if we did not see Seales play under Pooran sooner rather than later.</p>

                             <b style="color: #03A9Fa;"> Evin Lewis </b> returning should aid the side's top-order issues, but the middle is the real problem, with players such as Darren Bravo and Roston Chase consistently unable to build innings in 
                            white-ball formats. Pooran will need to improve his own batting form in ODIs, having only scored one half century in his last ten innings. While there is an abundance of lower-order allrounders 
                            who can accelerate an innings, the inability of the side to run singles and rotate strike has been a massive hindrance, particularly in 50-overs cricket where the side has lost their past two series, to Ireland and India.</p>

                     <div class="content">
                        <p>It will be up to Pooran to lead by example by scoring runs and guiding players by building partnerships. Pooran has improved his batting in this year's IPL, working closely with Brian Lara at Sunrisers Hyderabad. 
                            Could we see Lara integrated into the West Indies set-up in some capacity?</p>

                            Pollard, Bravo and Gayle had a combined 271 T20I caps between them and a staggering 588 ODI caps. Losing the core of the golden generation in the space of six months has created a massive void in the side.

                        <p>West Indies do still have experienced players who are flourishing, just not in maroon. Sunil Narine, Russell and Shimron Hetmyer, for various reasons, are not currently playing international cricket. Pooran will be aware 
                            of how valuable they are to the side, but will he decide to start conversations with them about a path back in?.</p>
